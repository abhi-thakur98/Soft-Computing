Implementation of Single Layer Perceptron (SLP) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) in python
- data.csv contains the data of various animals.
- Based on the features they are classified into different classes.
- SLP and MLP are designed to predict thier class.
- The layer in SLP has 7 neurons.
- MLP has two layers, the hidden layer has 10 neurons and the output layer has 7 neurons
- Graphs have been plotted representing the relation between epochs and error
